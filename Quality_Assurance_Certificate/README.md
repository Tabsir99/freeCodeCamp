# Quality Assurance Certification Projects

This directory contains the projects completed as part of the Quality Assurance certification from freeCodeCamp. Each project demonstrates various aspects of quality assurance, including web application testing using Mocha and Chai, and advanced Node.js/Express concepts such as authentication with PassportJS and Express Session, as well as a live chat system using Socket.IO and Passport-Socket.

## Projects

1. **Metric-Imperial Converter**  
   A web application that allows users to convert between metric and imperial units, with a comprehensive test suite to ensure the accuracy of the conversions.

2. **Issue Tracker**  
   A web application that allows users to create, view, and update issues, with a focus on testing the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

3. **Personal Library**  
   A web application that allows users to store and manage their personal book library, with a focus on testing the user authentication process using PassportJS and Express Session.

4. **Sudoku Solver**  
   A web application that takes a partially filled sudoku puzzle as input and returns the solved puzzle, with a focus on testing the logic for solving the sudoku puzzle.

5. **American / British Translator**  
   A web application that translates between American and British English, with a focus on testing the translation logic and handling edge cases.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows the execution of JavaScript code server-side.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data.
- **Mocha**: A feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.
- **Chai**: A BDD / TDD assertion library for Node.js and the browser that can be paired with any testing framework.
- **PassportJS**: A popular authentication middleware for Node.js that supports a variety of strategies, including local, OAuth, and more.
- **Socket.IO**: A real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication library for web applications.
