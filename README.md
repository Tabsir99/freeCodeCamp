# My freeCodeCamp Projects

This repository contains my personal projects completed as part of various freeCodeCamp courses. It serves as a showcase of my learning journey, coding skills development, and as a submission for freeCodeCamp certifications.

## Contents

This repo includes projects from the following freeCodeCamp courses (to be updated as I progress):

- [Course Name 1]
- [Course Name 2]
- [Course Name 3]

Each project is stored in its own directory with relevant files and documentation.

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:

1. To track my progress through freeCodeCamp courses
2. To showcase my coding skills to potential employers or collaborators
3. To serve as a personal reference for techniques and concepts I've learned
4. To submit project links for freeCodeCamp certification requirements

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the projects in this repository. Each project directory contains:

- Source code
- A README file explaining:
  - The project's purpose
  - How to run the project
  - Key features or functionalities
  - Technologies used
  - Any challenges faced and how they were overcome
- Any additional resources or notes

## Project Documentation

For each project, I aim to provide clear documentation to explain my work and thought process:

1. The README in each project directory serves as the main documentation.
2. Code comments explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions.

This documentation not only helps others understand my work but also reinforces my own learning and serves as a future reference.
