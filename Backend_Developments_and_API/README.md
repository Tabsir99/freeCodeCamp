# Backend Development and APIs Certification Projects

This directory contains the projects completed as part of the Backend Development and APIs certification from freeCodeCamp. Each project demonstrates various aspects of backend development, including RESTful API design, data manipulation, and server-side logic using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with Mongoose.

## Projects

1. **Timestamp Microservice**  
   A simple API that returns the current timestamp or converts a given date string into a Unix timestamp.

2. **Request Header Parser Microservice**  
   An API that parses and returns information from the request headers, such as the client's IP address, preferred language, and software details.

3. **URL Shortener Microservice**  
   A microservice that allows users to shorten a long URL, store it in a database, and retrieve the original URL by its shortened version.

4. **Exercise Tracker**  
   An API that allows users to log their exercises, including the type, duration, and date, and retrieve their exercise log.

5. **File Metadata Microservice**  
   An API that accepts a file upload and returns metadata about the file, such as its size and type.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows the execution of JavaScript code server-side.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data.
